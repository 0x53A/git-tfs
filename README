git-tfs is an two-way bridge between TFS and git, similar to git-svn.

git-tfs is a more tfs-ish derivative of git-svn.

Configuration-wise, here is what git-tfs should be doing:

[tfs-remote "<repository-id>"]
  url = <tfs server url>
  repository = <tfs repository path>
  fetch = refs/remotes/<repository-id>/master
  
In .git/tfs/, meta-data, especially the revision mapping, will be stored.
