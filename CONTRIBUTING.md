## Getting Involved

0. In your git-tfs clone, run `git config core.autocrlf true` so that all the line endings are unix line endings when you commit.

1. **Read the source.** It's hopefully not that intimidating.

2. **Check for issues.** There are a few issues that are low-hanging fruit. Feel free to pick them.

3. **Ask questions.** Feel free to drop me a line, or ask a question over at the [google group](http://groups.google.com/group/git-tfs-dev/), or join `#git-tfs` on FreeNode.

## Pull Requests

* In general, pull requests with unit tests get merged quicker than those without.
