I would like to make it as easy as possible to contribute to git-tfs. Here are some places to look if you're interested in helping out:

0. In your git-tfs clone, run `git config core.autocrlf true` so that all the line endings are unix line endings when you commit.

1. **Read the source.** It's hopefully not that intimidating.

2. **Check for issues.** There are a few issues that are low-hanging fruit. Feel free to pick them.

3. **Ask questions.** Feel free to drop me a line, or ask a question over at the [google group](http://groups.google.com/group/git-tfs-dev/).

Or, if you want to go above and beyond, it'd be awesome if you chipped in towards a Windows PC, so I can improve upon [this process](http://www.websequencediagrams.com/?lz=TWF0dCBvbiBhIG1hYy0-Z2l0LXRmcyBvbiBnaXRodWI6IFB1c2gKAAcRLT5KZW5raW4AJgVXaW5kb3dzOiBOZXcgY29tbWl0IQoADhIAHhZCdWlsZAAZFQCBDw06IEZBSUwhCg&s=napkin).
