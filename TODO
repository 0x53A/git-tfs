git-svn has these commands:
  create/pull:
    clone (init + fetch)
    init
    fetch
    rebase
  commit:
    dcommit
    set-tree (lower-level form of dcommit)
    commit-diff (pushes diff of git revs to svn, does not require init)
  history:
    blame
    find-rev
    info
    log
  svn features:
    create-ignore
    propget
    proplist
    show-externals
    show-ignore
  internals:
    migrate (upgrade from one version of git-svn to another)

The commands I plan to implement, in order of priority:
  init
  fetch
  clone (init+fetch)
  rebase
  (d)commit
  find-rev
  log
  commit-diff ?
  migrate ?
